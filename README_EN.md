# A People Map of Czechia

[ÄŒesky](../master/README.md) | English

Each name on [the map](https://jchrom.github.io/people-map-cs/index.html) represents a Wikipedia article about a person. Included are the top two hundred most viewed articles about Czechs, Czechoslovaks, or people connected to Czechia in some way.

The location of each name indicates a birthplace, a workplace, a place of death, a memorial site or other type of association with the person. The bigger the name, the more pageviews accumulated by the article. Click on the green bubble to display a popup with an extract and a link to Wikipedia.
